*Authenthication*

1. I create .htacess file to create a login pop-up that require Username and Password for the server side to make sure only valid-user can access the file

2. To make sure I can enter and access the file, I need to have right username and password, so I find .htpasswd file, and create my own username and password inside to allow me access the StudentRegistration file.

3. For client side, I has made a Sign in and Sign up page as authenthication layer of the Student Registration form, it allow user to Sign in their username and password, if they didn't register yet, they need to sign up first by insert their email, name, and password. All the information will key in into mysql database
